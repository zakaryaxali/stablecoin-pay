# Stablecoin Payment Platform

Building payment infrastructure exploring crypto-fiat settlement patterns.

## Overview
Experimenting with Rust-based architecture for stablecoin payments, focusing on:
- Blockchain transaction monitoring across multiple chains
- Webhook-based payment notification systems
- Reconciliation between blockchain state and payment databases
- Abstracting blockchain complexity for seamless UX

## Technical Focus
- Async payment processing in Rust
- Multi-chain support (Solana, Ethereum)
- Idempotent payment handling
- Real-time transaction confirmation tracking

## Motivation
Applying traditional payment infrastructure patterns (from fintech experience at Majority) to blockchain rails, exploring how to make crypto payments as seamless as traditional payments.

## Status
Early stage exploration - using Rust to build production-grade payment architecture patterns.
